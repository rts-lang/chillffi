    There are several possible directions for improvements and experiments:
    1. Pair work. The idea is simple - there is 1 zygote for cloning and 2 of its clones.
       Essentially, this is a pool of cloned zygotes. So there would be 3 of them in total.
       Basically, while one is working, another one is ready to take the hit right after it.
       This should significantly reduce the load in tasks where FFIs go one after another.
    1.1.
       (By the way, for restarting the main zygote this is very important — 
       you don't have to create a new dirty one, and if one died — you can quickly clone 
       a duplicate through fork() for duplication).
    2. Dynamic zygote warming. The idea is also simple - depending on the load,
       we increase or decrease the number of cloned zygotes.
       This can be done using different algorithms.
    3. Splitting the Runtime into 2 parts - where the main zygote as a process initially
       will not even see the main Runtime. Something like 2 programs inside one.
       But making 2 programs is not a great approach - there needs to be a single file.
       This can be implemented in different ways. The idea is simple -
       even if the main zygote does not use Runtime instructions,
       it still declares them and they exist inside,
       although they will never be used.
       In some way, exec() and ctor solve this, but this solution fully solves it.
