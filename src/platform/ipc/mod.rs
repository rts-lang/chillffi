/// 2. [`zygoteControlLoop`](Transport::zygoteControlLoop) — Main Zygote runs
///    its command loop forever, servicing `SpawnClone` requests.

///    [`Bootstrap`](Transport::Bootstrap) that will be forwarded through the
///    control channel back to the Runtime. Backends whose clones get their
///    endpoints by inheritance (Linux) do not have this step.
/// 4. [`runtimeConnect`](Transport::runtimeConnect) — Runtime rebuilds the
///    data endpoint from the bootstrap it received.
